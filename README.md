// HW00 for class CS151

Questions:

1) How much time did you spend on the homework?
    I would say that I spent around 5 hours on this? I've written almost the exact same program in CS1 so I had some prior knowledge.
2) What did you learn from this homework?
    I thought that this homework was a nice refresher on arrays and the basics of OOP.
